This sensor is categorized as a low-cost sensor that is widely used in various applications. This sensor has a significant deviation that leads to significant errors in the measurement result. The error produced by this sensor tends to increase proportionally to the measured distance. The implementation of a particular algorithm is required to reduce the error value. The model-based calibration is a solution to increase accuracy. The model-based solutions are no longer feasible if the states of the model have changed. The length of the usage of the sensor leads to sensor fatigue. Sensor fatigue is one of the causes of model state changes. If the drift is still within the tolerance limit, the sensor performance can still be restored using the calibration method. The model-based calibration calibrates the sensor by using the model. The update of the model must be made whenever the changing of the model state occurred. Since the manual model-making process is not an easy task, time, and cost required, then the Newton polynomial-based (Automatic Model Generation (AMG) has been implemented in this research. The AMG algorithm generates the new sensor model automatically based on the most updated states. This automatic model generation is implemented in the calibration process of the ultrasonic sensor. The implementation of a polynomial-based AMG algorithm for sensor calibration has been succeeded in improving the calibrated sensorâ€™s accuracy by 96.4% and reducing the MSE level from 25.6 to 0.914}, number={33}, journal={JURNAL INFOTEL}, author={Gandha, Gutama Indra and Santoso, Dewi Agustini}, year={2020}, month=aug, pages={115–122}, language={en} }

The PLTD engine in Ranai uses Bio Solar fuel to produce 1 MW (MegaWatt) of power. The PLTD engine in Ranai each has one tank with a capacity of 1820 liters. Within 1 hour of using a machine with a power of ±, 750 KW (Kilo Watt) can consume ± 182 liters of oil. The IoT system serves to simplify the work in the oil distribution system. This IoT system uses the ESP8266 as a microcontroller, the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor as a volume level reader for the oil in the engine tank, and a relay as a replacement switch pump on or off. This tool works in real-time to help reduce the risk of negligence in refueling the engine. The Device testing results showed good results because the error value in the measurement distance test was 0%. The tool can provide fast and accurate information because it is equipped with an information system using Android and notifications from email messages.}, number={11}, journal={International Journal of Electrical, Energy and Power System Engineering}, author={Prayetno, Eko and Nadapdap, Trisianto and Susanti, Ani Sari and Miranda, Delta}, year={2021}, month=feb, pages={134–138}, language={en} }

This creates a lot of problems with the unexpected and irregular overflow of parking volumes. In overcoming the above problems, a study was made that discusses the parking tracking system design with the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor intelligent working system using a smartphone and an Internet of Things (IoT) based web application. This parking tracking system will use the main component, namely the ultrasonic sensor and several other components, namely the NODEMCU ESP8266. The Internet of Things will be used in this parking smart work system to provide information to parking users through a web system about the location of vacant parking slots. With this web system, users will be able to use the booking model and see which parking positions are available. The model used is a chip that is programmed and placed in each parking lot so that it can transmit digital information signals to a server that can be accessed in real-time by the user. With the planning of a parking tracking intelligent work system, it is hoped that it can help management of parking usage by users.}, number={1}, journal={IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science}, publisher={IOP Publishing}, author={Sulistyawan, Vera Noviana and Salim, Nur Azis and Abas, Faizal Ghozali and Aulia, Najma}, year={2023}, month=jun, pages={012028}, language={en} }

Humanoid robots, like robots of other types, are, first, equipped with sensory systems similar to the senses of a human. However, this approach is not enough. All possible types and kinds of sensors should be used, including those that are similar to those of other animals and creations (in particular, echolocation in dolphins and bats), as well as sensors that have no analogues in the wild. This paper discusses the main issues that arise when working with the HC-SR04 ultrasound rangefinder based on the STM32VLDISCOVERY evaluation board. The characteristics of similar modules for comparison are given. A subroutine for working with the sensor is given.}, number={3}, journal={Journal of Physics: Conference Series}, publisher={IOP Publishing}, author={Zhmud, V A and Kondratiev, N O and Kuznetsov, K A and Trubin, V G and Dimitrov, L V}, year={2018}, month=may, pages={032189}, language={en} }
